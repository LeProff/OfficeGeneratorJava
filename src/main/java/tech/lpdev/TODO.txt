- Expand the rooms downward to fill any empty space
- Add bathroom and closets randomly, but they have to be touching a walkway (Ask if we want random or manually added)

- what to do with last floor


POSSIBLE:
- distinguish between stairs and elevators
- modify envelop to have as many possible layouts as possible

CONFIG
- Number of people per office (Currently 10) [possibly a range rather then a fixed number]
- size at which we would consider adding an extra office
- cluster executive or embed them
- bathrooms per floor
- storage rooms per floor

- Create a system for unassigned office space

- for drawing, if rooms are big enough add multiple doors


- get files to be workable when compiled (jar)
- start getting to drawing

###############################################################################

- pre-allocate washrooms and closets (either in file or pre define randomly)
- add conference rooms first
- then place all offices

- exterior dimension markings
- for every office, drop in a picture *
- add doors to offices (more per room if large enough) *

###############################################################################

- allow for more than 2 envelop styles ***

- Calculating the number of people per connected office
    - count all conected points and divide by 80

- for adding meeting rooms - DONE
    - have a 30% chance of adding a meeting room
    - every failed placement increases the chance by 5-10%

- for visual parts - WIP
    - add doors (open inwards)
    - add labels

- when you run out of rooms, add a new type of area for un-used

!!!! BUGS !!!!
- Last floor placing multiple different types
    - Most likely an issue with how counter is being handled
    - adding extra rooms

- rooms getting placed in the center of the floor
    - try making a check method to see if the room is touching either a walkway or another room of the same type


#####
- for doors:
    - for each side in contact with a walkway, find center of wall and draw door

- fix orphaned rooms (check if against wall or same roomType)

* elevator: box with X in it
* stairs: box with steps in it

###############################################################################

produce workable output
DONE -> working doors
DONE -> working labels [dept_name + (num_people_in_room)] (people per room) (boardrooms don't need number of people)
DONE -> Word docx in folder
DONE -> Get rid of a colours
DONE* -> try to remove orphaned rooms (add doors if need-be)
* add symbols for bathrooms and access points
* add open space rooms (un-used room type)

To Discuss:
- some storage rooms are too small and doors won't fit/generate
- the word docs lib is causing errors, come up with solutions (possibly output txt file and he can parse it)
- certain labels are way too long

make a txt file out separate with %

###############################################################################

DONE -> text file output for company data (use company #toString)
- attempt to fix top floors

- email system for making envelopes

* fix filling to make more square rooms
